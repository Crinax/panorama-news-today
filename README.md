# Panorama News Today

Simple program that gets panorama news today (https://panorama.pub) and speaks them using the SSIP Protocol (Speech Dispatcher)

## Requirements

- Speech Dispatcher (with activated socket: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Speech_dispatcher#Socket_activation)

## Additional Requirements

- In repo I use RHVoice but you can use the voice you like best

## Some text...

I've tested it in CachyOS and I think it works in all arch-based distributions, but I'm not aware of any others
